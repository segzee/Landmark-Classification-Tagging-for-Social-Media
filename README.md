# Landmark Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for landmark classification using transfer learning. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying images of landmarks. We utilize the VGG16 architecture and transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights from a diverse dataset like ImageNet.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src**: Contains source code for the project.
  - `transfer.py`: Defines functions for creating and testing the transfer learning model.
  - `data.py`: Provides functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  - `optimization.py`: Implements functions to get optimizer and loss.
  - `train.py`: Includes functions for training the model.
  - `predictor.py`: Defines the Predictor class for making predictions.
- **checkpoints**: Stores the trained model weights.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the project dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Step 0: Setting up

Execute the provided setup cells to ensure the environment is correctly configured. Make sure the required dependencies are installed.

### Step 1: Create transfer learning architecture

Complete the `get_model_transfer_learning` function in `src/transfer.py`. Run the provided test to ensure the function works correctly.

### Step 2: Train, validation, and test

Define hyperparameters and train the transfer learning model using the specified architecture. Experiment with hyperparameters to achieve high validation accuracy.

### Step 3: Test the Model

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to ensure generalization. Verify that the test accuracy is above 60% and comparable to the validation accuracy.

```python
# Example code for testing the model
import torch
from src.train import one_epoch_test
from src.transfer import get_model_transfer_learning

model_transfer = get_model_transfer_learning("vgg16", n_classes=num_classes)
model_transfer.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoints/model_transfer.pt'))

one_epoch_test(data_loaders['test'], model_transfer, loss)
Step 4: Export using torchscript
Export the best-fit model using torchscript for use in applications. The exported model is saved in the checkpoints directory.

Results
The project achieves a test accuracy of 67% on landmark images using the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning.
